- Each person must be treated as an **individual** with regard to their specific **risks** & **needs**.  
- Access to **amenities** must be balanced with the person's **welfare**, **dignity** & human **rights** against any risk to safety & security (of both staff & themselves).  
- Each person must be **continually** **monitored** & assessed (e.g. medical conditions, self-harm risks, harming others risk).  
- Facility staff must **communicate** & understand all risks, issues & information as a **unit**.
