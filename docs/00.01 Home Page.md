Welcome to InfoPol, a knowledge base created by Nathan Haymes. InfoPol is built around asking 'but why'. It provides simple overviews & then provides further information in it's sections, answering 'but why do we do that' & similar questions. It is:  
  
- Searchable, expandable & accessible information anywhere.  
- Clear, concise & useable guides that keep it simple.  
- A community & collaborative place for us to build with each other.  
  
I am pushing a move away from PDF's, Word Documents and other platforms. The information kept on this guide is 'non-sensitive' & can be viewed by the public, were the password to be leaked. VPM's, legislation & the equipment we use is all available for viewing by the public at any time.  
  
Please find the below Table of Contents, but please utilise the search if you're stumped.
